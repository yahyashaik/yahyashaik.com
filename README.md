# Dynamic Landing Page design inspired by minimalistic business cards.
### Utilizing JavaScript to make dynamic experience

The Landing Page Project is an example of how to harness the power of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by the following:

- Creating new elements and changing property and values just like the background color and its styles.
- Editing styles and functionality for activated and deactivated elements.
- Automatic repositioning on-hover.

## Features

- A Dynamically created navigation menu for multi-platform links., and no matter how many items are added in `index.html` the menu will adapt to it in automatic fashion.
- The page automatically redirects to the desired section when you click on it.
- The activated section and its peer change their styles in order to exhibit their active status.
- The previous activated section and its peer return to their native style.

## Tech

- Most other development features -including CSS new rules- are done in `js/app.js`.
- Developed by [Muhammet Orazmyradov] - a Personal Site Landing Page.
